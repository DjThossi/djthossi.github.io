                <p>
                    Today it's crystal clear why we need unit tests. Even integration and acceptance tests are quite
                    common but who is making sure that your pages are working in production environment?
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'd like to show in detail how smoke tests will help achieving this goal and why you should try to
                    burn down your production server.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>This is a complete new talk I'm preparing right now.</strong> I want to show that smoke
                    tests are a good way
                    to approve that all your critical URLs are working. I will show how the workflow of deployments to
                    production environments could look like. How the correct Server setup will help to get SmokeTests
                    running and how we make sure that SmokeTests are not affecting our customers.
